### OAUTH2 

The gcloud auth command group lets you grant and revoke authorization to Cloud SDK (gcloud) to access Google Cloud Platform. Typically, when scripting Cloud SDK tools for use on multiple machines, using gcloud auth **activate-service-account** is recommended.

While running gcloud auth commands, the **--account** flag can be specified to any command to use that account without activation.

* List all accounts

>Lists accounts whose credentials have been obtained using gcloud init, gcloud auth login and gcloud auth activate-service-account, and shows which account is active. The active account is used by gcloud and other Cloud SDK tools to access Google Cloud Platform. 
> 
> gcloud auth list [--filter-account=FILTER_ACCOUNT] [--filter=EXPRESSION] [--limit=LIMIT] [--page-size=PAGE_SIZE] [--sort-by=[FIELD,…]] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG …]
>  

* Login 

> Obtains access credentials for your user account via a web-based authorization flow. When this command completes successfully, it sets the active account in the current configuration to the account specified. If no configuration exists, it creates a configuration named default.
>  
> gcloud auth login [ACCOUNT] [--no-activate] [--brief] [--enable-gdrive-access] [--force] [--no-launch-browser] [--update-adc] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG …]
> 

* Activate a service account

> To allow gcloud (and other tools in Cloud SDK) to use service account credentials to make requests, use this command to import these credentials from a file that contains a private authorization key, and activate them for use in gcloud. gcloud auth activate-service-account serves the same function as gcloud auth login but uses a service account rather than Google user credentials.
>  
> gcloud auth activate-service-account [ACCOUNT] --key-file=KEY_FILE [--password-file=PASSWORD_FILE     | --prompt-for-password] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG …]

* Revoke

>  Revokes credentials for the specified user accounts or service accounts.
>  When given a user account, this command revokes the user account token on the server. 
>  When given a service account, this command does not revoke the service account token on the server because service account tokens are not revocable
>  

* Print access token

> Print an access token for the specified account.
> 
> gcloud auth print-access-token [ACCOUNT] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG …]
> 

* Print identity token
 
> Print an identity token for the specified account.
>  
> gcloud auth print-identity-token [ACCOUNT] [--audiences=[AUDIENCES,…]] [--include-email] [--include-license --token-format=TOKEN_FORMAT; default="standard"] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG …]
> 

* Configure docker

> gcloud auth configure-docker adds the Docker credHelper entry to Docker's configuration file, or creates the file if it doesn't exist. This will register gcloud as the credential helper for all Google-supported Docker registries
>  
> gcloud auth configure-docker [REGISTRIES] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG …]
> 

### Application Defaults

Application Default Credentials (ADC) provide a method to get credentials used in calling Google APIs. The gcloud auth application-default command group allows you to manage active credentials on your machine that are used for local application development. These credentials are only used by Google client libraries in your own application.


* Login

> Obtains user access credentials via a web flow and puts them in the well-known location for Application Default Credentials (ADC).
>  
> gcloud auth application-default login [--client-id-file=CLIENT_ID_FILE] [--no-launch-browser] [--scopes=SCOPES,[SCOPES,…]] [--no-add-quota-project     | --disable-quota-project] [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG …]
>  

* Revoke

> Revokes Application Default Credentials that have been previously generated by gcloud auth application-default login and deletes the local credential file.
>  
> gcloud auth application-default revoke [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG …]
>

* Print access token

> gcloud auth application-default print-access-token generates and prints an access token for the current Application Default Credential (ADC). 
>  
> gcloud auth application-default print-access-token [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG …]
>  

* Set quota project

> Before running this command, an ADC must already be generated using $gcloud auth application-default login.
>  
> gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project QUOTA_PROJECT_ID [GCLOUD_WIDE_FLAG …]
